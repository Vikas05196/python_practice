# create a variable and assign it a dictionary that has 5 key value pairs

dict_example ={"rama":"konkan","rate":"rupess",1:222,6:23.45,2:888}
print(dict_example)

# print and access the value held at the third key in the dictionary
print(dict_example[1])
# use the in keyword to check if a key appears in the dictionary and print the result
print(1 in dict_example)
# use not in to check if a key does not appear in the dictionary and print the result
print(1 not in dict_example)

# solutions:
dictionary = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3, "d": 4, "e": 5}
print(dictionary["c"])
print("a" in dictionary)
print("b" not in dictionary)
