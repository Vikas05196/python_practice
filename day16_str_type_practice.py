# Create a variable and assign it a float

float_a = 3.56
print(type(float_a))

# Use print() and type() to print the data type of the variable in the output

# Use str() on the variable from step 1 and concatenate it with the string " is a float." then use print() to display the result

# print() the string "Hello, I'm [name], it's nice to meet you!" including quotes 
# (you will need to use the \' or \" escape sequence depending on whether you enclose your strings in single quotes or double quotes.)
